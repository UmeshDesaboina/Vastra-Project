# Payment and Order Management Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of enhanced payment status management and return/replacement functionality for the e-commerce platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Status Management

#### Backend Changes
- **Order Model** (`models/orderModel.js`): Added return/replacement request fields
- **Order Controller** (`controllers/orderController.js`):
  - Payment is automatically marked as "paid" for Stripe, PayPal, Credit Card, and Debit Card payments
  - Cash on Delivery (COD) orders remain "unpaid" until delivery
  - Upon delivery, COD orders are automatically marked as "paid"

#### Frontend Changes
- **MyOrdersScreen**: Updated to show "✓ Payment Successful" for paid orders and "Pending" for unpaid
- **OrderScreen**: Updated payment display with success/pending alerts

### 2. Order Filtering and Searching

#### Enhanced Search Functionality
The admin order list now supports comprehensive search by:
- Order ID
- Order status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)
- Payment method
- User email
- User name

### 3. Return/Replacement Functionality

#### Backend Implementation

**Order Model Fields:**
```javascript
returnRequest: {
  requested: Boolean,
  reason: String,
  status: Enum ['Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected', 'Completed'],
  requestedAt: Date,
  processedAt: Date,
  adminNotes: String
}

replacementRequest: {
  requested: Boolean,
  reason: String,
  status: Enum ['Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected', 'Completed'],
  requestedAt: Date,
  processedAt: Date,
  adminNotes: String
}
```

**New API Endpoints:**

User Endpoints:
- `POST /api/orders/:id/return` - Request return for delivered order
- `POST /api/orders/:id/replacement` - Request replacement for delivered order

Admin Endpoints:
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/return-status` - Update return request status
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/replacement-status` - Update replacement request status

#### Frontend Implementation

**User Features (OrderScreen):**
- Return/Replacement buttons appear only for delivered orders
- Modal forms for submitting return/replacement requests with reason
- Display of request status and admin notes
- Prevents duplicate requests

**Admin Features (OrderListScreen):**
- Visual indicators (icons) for orders with return/replacement requests
- Dedicated modals for managing return/replacement requests
- Ability to approve, reject, or mark requests as completed
- Admin notes field for communication with customers

## Payment Status Logic

### At Order Creation:
```javascript
// Any payment method except COD or "Cash on Delivery" is considered paid immediately
if (paymentMethod && paymentMethod !== 'COD' && paymentMethod !== 'Cash on Delivery') {
  isPaid = true
  paidAt = now
} else {
  isPaid = false
}
```

### At Order Delivery:
```javascript
if (status === 'Delivered' && !isPaid && (paymentMethod === 'COD' || paymentMethod === 'Cash on Delivery')) {
  isPaid = true
  paidAt = now
}
```

### Payment Methods Used:
- **PayPal** - Paid immediately
- **Stripe** - Paid immediately  
- **COD** (Cash on Delivery) - Paid after delivery

## Return/Replacement Workflow

### User Flow:
1. Order is delivered
2. User sees "Request Return" and "Request Replacement" buttons
3. User submits request with reason
4. Request status shows as "Pending"
5. User can view admin notes when admin processes the request

### Admin Flow:
1. Admin sees return/replacement indicators in order list
2. Admin clicks on indicator to open management modal
3. Admin reviews customer reason
4. Admin can:
   - Approve the request
   - Reject the request
   - Mark as completed
   - Add notes for the customer
5. Status is updated and customer can see the result

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `models/orderModel.js` - Added return/replacement fields
- `controllers/orderController.js` - Payment logic + return/replacement handlers
- `routes/orderRoutes.js` - New routes for return/replacement

### Frontend:
- `screens/MyOrdersScreen.js` - Updated payment status display
- `screens/OrderScreen.js` - Added return/replacement UI for users
- `screens/admin/OrderListScreen.js` - Added return/replacement management for admin

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Payment Status:**
   - Create order with online payment methods → should be marked paid immediately
   - Create order with COD → should be unpaid until delivered
   - Mark COD order as delivered → should auto-mark as paid

2. **Return/Replacement:**
   - Submit return request on delivered order
   - Verify request appears in admin panel
   - Test approve/reject/complete actions
   - Verify user sees updated status and admin notes

3. **Search/Filter:**
   - Search by order ID, email, name, status, payment method
   - Test date range filtering
   - Test paid/unpaid filtering

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication
- Return/replacement endpoints verify order ownership
- Admin endpoints require admin privileges
- Input validation on all request fields
